# Discussions

Discussions is a website I made after learning some of the PHP basics and my first real attempt at MVC model. Everything was created from the ground up mostly by myself, some of the code used was taken from laracasts.com PHP for Beginners course.

You could say that this website is a reddit clone because the main idea while creating this project was to try and recreate some of the most basic functions of reddit.

It is not yet complete and I'm still refactoring my code, working on implementing other features.
